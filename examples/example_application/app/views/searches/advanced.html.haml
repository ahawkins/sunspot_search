%p 
  Here is an demo of the advanced functionality using transforms. We use transforms to turn
  date/time attributes into the correct date pickers for the selected operator. 
  Then for numeric attributes, change them into sliders.

#advanced-search
  = sunspot_search_form_for(@search, :url => searches_path, :html => {:method => :get}) do |form| 
    = form.inputs do 
      = form.keywords 

    = form.inputs do 
      = form.search_fields :hint => "The search mataches all fields by default. You can selet fields if you only want to search them." 

    = form.conditions do |condition| 
      = condition.attributes 
      = condition.operators 
      = condition.type 
      = condition.value 
      = condition.choices 
      = condition.remove_condition_button 

    = form.buttons do 
      = form.add_condition_button 

    = form.inputs do 
      = form.sort_by 
      = form.sort_direction 

    = form.inputs do 
      = form.pagination_options
