# SunspotSearch - Easily Create Complex Searches in Your Views

SunspotSearch is a gem to model complicated searches so they can presented in views,
processed, saved, and ran again later if required. It essentially wraps existing
functionality provided by Solr in a way that you can easily make a form, 
pass the params through the controller, and to a class that will create the search logic 
and return the results.
